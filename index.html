      "A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry of Austrian origin,
      named for its historical crescent shape. Croissants and other viennoiserie
      are made of a layered yeast-leavened dough." A croissant is a buttery,
      flaky, French viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the Austrian
      kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough.[2] Croissants
      are named for their historical crescent shape, the dough is layered with
      butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a
      thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a
      layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry. Crescent-shaped breads
      have been made since the Renaissance, and crescent-shaped cakes possibly
      since antiquity[3] but using brioche dough. Kipferls have long been a
      staple of Austrian, and French bakeries and p√¢tisseries. The modern
      croissant was developed in the early 20th century when French bakers
      replaced the brioche dough of the kipferl with a yeast-leavened laminated
      dough.[4] In the late 1970s, the development of factory-made, frozen,
      preformed but unbaked dough made them into a fast food that could be
      freshly baked by unskilled labor. The croissant bakery, notably the La
      Croissanterie chain, was a French response to American-style fast food,[5]
      and as of 2008, 30‚Äì40% of the croissants sold in French bakeries and
      patisseries were baked from frozen dough.[6]
